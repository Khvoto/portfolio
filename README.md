Property of Jens Ã–sterqvist,
Sole author of the code written in this repository.

This is my portfolio repository for private development and viewing only. No external collaborators will be added as this would take away from the idea of it being my portfolio, but anyone is welcome to give feedback and suggestions on new ideas to implement, as this only serves as new inspiration and brings me forward as a developer.

If anyone reading this sees any glaring mistakes considering best practices, or if I'm writing code in a bad way, please tell me, as bad habits should be removed as soon as possible.

This part of my journey will consist purely of:
-HTML
-CSS
-JS

As these are the foundation of the current web. 
Future projects will incorparate more modern technologies and frameworks.

I am currently working on two side project that will be linked to through my portfolio, and I hope those will be as enjoyable to read as they are to write.
